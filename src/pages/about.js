              I studied fine and studio art at Hong-ik University in South Korea
              and the Cooper Union in New York City. After graduate schools, I
              translated my learnings of the human-artwork interaction into the
              human-computer interaction. Since then, my goal is always to
              communicate with the audience naturally.

              I love drawing illustrations and digitalizes them to create
              animation. I am also very talented Amazon box artist.{" "}

              Telling a story is the one of the most effective way delivering
              information. When we tell a story, the information is flowing with
              context. In storytelling, we don't dump information in audience's
              face.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I was in college, my biggest challenge was delivering the
              message through my artwork because I wouldnâ€™t be around all the
              time to explain things.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, I have to tell a story about my product without standing by
              my users. And I need to do that visually. I should be able to
              understand the flow of thoughts of my users, and curate the
              information to fit with the context at times.

            <p>
              One thing that I learned from my past experience is, more elements
              of the experience I understand, better my product justification
              gets. Because users experience the product as a whole, not
              component by component.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have experience of a studio artist, a visual designer, an UI
              deisgner, a front-end developer, and an interaction designer for
              past 10+ years. And that helps me to grow as an all-around product
              designer.
